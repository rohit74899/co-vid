    <h2>Covid-19: Maharashtra's Hiware Bazar shows the way of breaking the chain</h2>
    <p>
        “We have successfully managed to break the chain during the second wave,” Popatrao Pawar, the Sarpanch of Hiware Bazar, told DH over phone. 
         Speaking about how Covid-19 was controlled, he said: “When the cases were reported initially, we decided to check body temperatures and oxygen saturation level of all villagers compulsorily.

    </p>
    <p>
        Since the RT-PCR report was taking 8 to 10 days, we decided to conduct rapid antigen test on the suspect cases...There were some false negatives 
The people who were suspected to have Covid-19 were quarantined at the training centre of the Yashwant Krishi Gram and Watershed Development Trust (YKWDT), a non-governmental organization set up by Hiware Bazar’s Gram Sabha (GS) in 1994.
“The reports were shown to expert doctors and some patients were shifted to hospitals, of which four needed oxygen support,” he said, adding that every day, he speaks to 23 to 30 families. “They also call me on the phone or our volunteers,” he said.
Ahmednagar’s Collector Rajendra Bhosale and Zilla Parishad CEO Rajendra Kshirsagar have appreciated the efforts of Hiware Bazar and Pawar.

    <h2>Village Survey</h2>
    <p>
        He said that the number kept rising and on April 2, the villagers decided to form committees for surveying the villages and identifying the affected persons in the families. The surveys were led by Gram Panchayats members, village-based NGOs and local youths. Oximeters and thermometers were purchased for the surveys.
The initial surveys led to the identification of 19 positive cases and 12 persons who had negative antigen test but were declared positive with the RTPCR test. For all such people and their families the dairy animals care, transporting milk to the town and carrying out agriculture work were done by local volunteers. Separate teams with four vehicles were created for carrying the patients to the local hospitals, Pawar said.
Eventually, 47 people suffered from the infections. Out of 47, eight had to be shifted to ICU with ventilator support. With such a scary scenario it was decided by all the villagers to control the virus by May 15, infected people voluntarily admitted themselves into quarantine facilities and followed all the social distancing norms strictly. The village is Covid free now, he said.

        Kshirsagar points out that formation of volunteer teams at village level for the care of patients and their families, quarantining of farmers who supervised migrants farm, hiring of agricultural workers, taking care of the dairy animals of farmers who have been affected by Covid, had led to a major decline in positive cases in Hiware Bazar. The learnings from here have been passed on to the other Gram Panchayats through video-conferencing, he said.
He added that replicating such efforts in the district coupled with massive anti-body and RTPCR testing, has led to the fall in positivity rate to 10-11 per cent, which was 30 to 40 per cent in April. Daily new infections have also come down to less than 2,000, which had risen to almost 4,500 in April in the district.
